# The Works of Alexander Neckam

A collection of the Latin writings of Alexander Neckam (1157–1217), Augustinian canon and abbot of Cirencester, encoded using [EpiDoc](http://epidoc.sourceforge.net). A website is under development to present this material in a readable fashion.

The texts here are imperfect working editions, generally based on a single manuscript, and have not yet been thoroughly checked. They are being made public on the grounds that, while imperfect, they are more accessible than anything else currently available.

Corrections and contributions of new texts (in any format) are welcome. In the long term, it is hoped that searchable versions of the entire corpus of Alexander's works will be made available.
