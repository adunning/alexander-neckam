# The Works of Alexander Neckam

A collection of the Latin writings of Alexander Neckam (1157–1217), Augustinian canon and abbot of Cirencester, encoded using [EpiDoc](http://epidoc.sourceforge.net). A website is under development to present this material in a readable fashion.

The texts here are working editions, generally based on a single manuscript, and have not been thoroughly checked. They have been made public on the grounds that, while imperfect, they are more accessible than anything else currently available. Corrections and other contributions are most welcome.
